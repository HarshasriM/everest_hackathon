# Audio Assets

## Ringtone Setup

Add your ringtone file here with the name `ringtone.mp3`

### How to Add:
1. Find or download a ringtone audio file (MP3 format)
2. Rename it to `ringtone.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory (`assets/audio/`)
4. The fake call feature will automatically use it

### Where to Find Ringtones:
- You can use any royalty-free ringtone from the internet
- Convert any audio file to MP3 format
- Keep file size reasonable (under 1MB recommended)

### Note:
The app will work without the ringtone file but won't play sound during incoming fake calls.
